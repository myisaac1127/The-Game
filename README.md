sce is the scene aka what text is displayed 


I need you all to figure out how to reproduce this and how to go from battle back to story. 

I have given you all the tools you need to succeed all you need to do is pay attention. 

I have written a message to each of you 

Aaron: This code may look dummy thicc but i need you to read all the comments and help everyone 

Caden: You are my number 2 so i need you to guide the group, you are now the group leader 

Chente: Work on the story and dialogue for the program, if i hear that you slacked you will be voted off the island 

Micha: Get off redit 

Ms castro: Work with adam, at this point the code is here all it is, is copy and paste give these student insight and inspiration, Mention history to get the steam pumping 

Adam: Thank you for being on the team i hope to have you in future projects 

Now all you gammers this is a make or break moment, you will either fail me or make me proud. 

The only way to fail is to not try at all

 If you need to contact me then talk to Robbie he has my cell also Mr Mcguire may or may not have it

 "In onese;f lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. 
Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself."
